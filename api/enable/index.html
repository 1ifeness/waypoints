<h2>waypoint.enable()</h2>

<div class="reference">
  <p>Enables the waypoint, allowing the handler function to trigger.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Returns</dt>
    <dd>The same Waypoint instance.</dd>
  </dl>
</div>

<p>By default, waypoints are enabled and calling this function will do nothing. However, if you have disabled a waypoint previously either by calling the <a href="{{ site.url }}/api/disable">disable method</a> or passing <code>enabled: false</code> as an option when creating the waypoint, calling this method will renable triggering of the handler when the waypoint is crossed.</p>

<p>If the waypoint was crossed while it was disabled those triggers do not accumulate and fire when renabled. They are lost. This is the point of disabling.</p>
